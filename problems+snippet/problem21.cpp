/*Chef's professor is planning to give his class a group assignment. There are 2N students in the class, with distinct roll numbers ranging from 
1 to 2N. Chef's roll number is X.
The professor decided to create N groups of 2 students each. The groups were created as follows: the first group consists of roll numbers 
1 and 2N, the second group of roll numbers 2 and 2Nâˆ’1, and so on, with the final group consisting of roll numbers N+1.
Chef wonders who his partner will be. Can you help Chef by telling him the roll number of his partner?*/#include <iostream>
