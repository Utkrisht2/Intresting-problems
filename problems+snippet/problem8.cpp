/* Sebestian is a very lazy person. Whatever work is supposed to be finished in x units of time, he finishes it in mâˆ—x units of time.
 But there is always a limit to laziness, so he delays the work by at max d units of time.
 Given x,m,d, find the maximum time taken by Sebestian to complete the work.*/
