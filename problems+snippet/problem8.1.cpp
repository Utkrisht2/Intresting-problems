/*You are given three distinct positive integers X,Y, and Z. Your task is to find integers A and B such that:
B is equal to one of the three given numbers;
A is equal to the product of remaining two numbers;
A is divisible by B.
Print A and B which satisfy the given conditions. If no such pair of A and B exists, print âˆ’1 instead.*/
